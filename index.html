                    <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to always credit an affiliate when shopping on Amazon. Usually, when you want to credit an affiliate before shopping on Amazon, you need to go to the affiliate's website, find the Amazon affiliate link, and go to Amazon through that link. Doing that every time you want to shop on Amazon can be tedious, Philanthropist wants to make crediting affiliates simple.</p>
                    <p>With Philanthropist, you configure the affiliate you want to use one time and every time you visit Amazon after that, Philanthropist will ensure that your favorite affiliate is getting credit.</p>
