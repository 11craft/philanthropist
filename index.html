<section class='what'>
  <h2><small>What is it?</small> <span class='highlight'>A browser extension.</span></h2>
  <p>Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite projects and causes. All you need to do is tell Philanthropist who you'd like to support and assuming they're a member of the Amazon Associates program, they'll receive some kickback for every purchase you make.</p>

<section class='why'>
  <h2><small>Why use it?</small> <span class='highlight'>Support your favorite projects and causes.</span></h2>
  <p>Many projects and causes rely on the Amazon Associates program as a source of revenue. Usually they'll ask interested parties to click through a banner on their website before they make any purchases on Amazon. This sounds easy enough, but for impromptu purchases, it's very easy to forget to click through. This is where Philanthropist comes in. After you install and configure Philanthropist, any time you visit Amazon, it'd be as if you got there by clicking through your favorite associate's banner. This will ensure that your favorite associate will always receive a percentage of the money you spend on Amazon.</p>

  <p>A list of known Amazon associates is maintained <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/jharding/philanthropist/wiki/List-of-Associate-IDs'>here</a>. If you know of an associate that isn't on the list, feel free to add it yourself or contact me at <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/JakeHarding'>@JakeHarding</a> and I'll add it.</p>
