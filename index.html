  <h2><small>What is it?</small> <span class='highlight'>A browser extension.</span></h2>
  <p>Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite projects. If you're a fan of a project that's a member of the Amazon Associates program, you can easily configure Philanthropist to make sure anytime you're browsing Amazon, your session is associated with that project.</p>

<section class='why'>
  <h2><small>Why use it?</small> <span class='highlight'>Support your favorite projects.</span></h2>
  <p>Many projects produce amazing work and offer it free of charge. Sometimes their only source of revenue comes from the Amazon Associates program. You'll see links on their sites that take you to Amazon and if you buy anything after clicking through, they'll receive some money. This doesn't cost you anything extra, so why not do this for every purchase you make on Amazon? Well because sometimes you forget to go to your favorite project's site and click through their Amazon links and instead you go to Amazon directly. Philanthropist will make sure that even if you go to Amazon directly, any purchase you make will result in your favorite project getting some kickback.</p>
  <p>A list of known Amazon associates is maintained in <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/jharding/philanthropist/wiki/List-of-Associate-IDs'>Philanthropist's wiki on GitHub</a>. Is your favorite project missing form the list? Feel free to add it.</p>
