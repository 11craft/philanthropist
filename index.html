<section class='why'>
  <h2><small>Why use it?</small> <span class='highlight'>Support your favorite projects.</span></h2>
  <p>Many projects produce amazing work and offer it for free of charge. Sometimes their only source of revenue comes from the Amazon Associates program. You'll see links on their sites that take you to Amazon and if you buy anything after clicking through, they'll receive some money. This doesn't cost you anything extra, so why not do this for every purchase you make on Amazon? Well because sometimes you forget to go to your favorite project's site and click through their Amazon links, instead you go to Amazon directly. Philanthropist will make sure that even if you go to Amazon directly, any purchase you make will result in your favoirte project getting some money.</p>
  <p>A list of known Amazon associates is maintained in <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/jharding/philanthropist/wiki/List-of-Associate-IDs'>Philanthropist's wiki on Github</a>. Is your favoirte project missing form the list? Feel free to add it.</p>
